Algorithms 

During parsing problems, you realize that how many core things you got to understand more deep(whether it’s swift itself or logic along with algorithms). 

Once you get through lots of different problems, you learn various methods in approaching problem solving.

You realize that your initial concerns about the problems can eventually be solved. 

It’s a great way to learn data structures! You utilize them in practice. You interact with almost each data structure. 


It’s a long file with descriptions of problems and their solutions.
